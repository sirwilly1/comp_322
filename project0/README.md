# Comp322
So far with the first project, I was able to do all the conversion for the most part.
The program reads 8bit binary numbers from text file and converts it to ASCII,DECIMAL,and tells the Parity
Things that need to be complete/improved :
1)correct padding of diffrent fields so the line up and look better
2)figure out how to deal with unknown ASCII chars like DEL
3)If a non binary sting is in text file find way to not crash
